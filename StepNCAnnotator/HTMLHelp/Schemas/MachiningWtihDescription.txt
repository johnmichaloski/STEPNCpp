An axis1 placement is defined in terms of a locating point (inherited from the placement  supertype) and an axis direction; this is either the direction of axis or defaults to (0.0,0.0,1.0).  The actual direction for the axis placement is given by the derived attribute z.

The location and orientation in three­dimensional space of two  mutually perpendicular axes. An axis2 placement 3d is defined in terms of a point, (inherited  from the placement supertype), and two (ideally orthogonal) axes. It can be used to locate and  orientate a non axi­symmetric object in space and to define a placement coordinate system.  The entity includes a point which forms the origin of the placement coordinate system. Two  direction vectors are required to complete the definition of the placement coordinate system.  The axis is the placement Z axis direction and the ref direction is an approximation to the  placement X axis direction.

<bezier_curve>
	<description>
This subtype represents in the most general case a piecewise B'ezier curve. 
This is a special type of curve which can be represented as a type of b spline curve in which the knots are evenly spaced and have high multiplicities. Suitable default values for the knots and knot multiplicities are derived in this case. A B­spline curve is a piecewise B'ezier curve if it is quasi­uniform except that the interior knots have multiplicity degree rather than having multiplicity one. In this subtype the knot spacing is 1.0, starting at 0.0. A piecewise B'ezier curve which has only two knots, 0.0 and 1.0, each of multiplicity (degree+1), is a simple B'ezier curve.

<pcurve>
	<description>
A pcurve is a 3D curve defined by means of a 2D curve in the parameter  space of a surface. If the curve is parametrised by the function (u; v) = f(t), and the surface  is parametrised by the function (x; y; z) = g(u; v), the pcurve is parametrised by the function  (x; y; z) = g(f(t)).  

A pcurve definition contains a reference to its basis surface and an indirect reference to a  2D curve through a definitional representation entity. The 2D curve, being in parameter  space, is not in the context of the basis surface. Thus a direct reference is not possible. For the  2D curve the variables involved are u and v, which occur in the parametric representation of  the basis surface rather than x; y Cartesian coordinates. The curve is only defined within the  parametric range of the surface.

<quasi_uniform_surface>
	<description>
This is a special type of b spline surface in which the knots  are evenly spaced, and except for the first and last, have multiplicity 1. Suitable default values  for the knots and knot multiplicities are derived in this case.  A B­spline is quasi­uniform if and only if the knots are of multiplicity (degree + 1) at the ends,  of multiplicity 1 elsewhere, and they differ by a positive constant from the preceding knot. In  this subtype the knot spacing is 1.0, starting from 0.0.

<edge_loop>
	<description>
An edge loop is a loop with nonzero extent. It is a path in which the  start and end vertices are the same. Its domain, if present, is a closed curve. An edge loop  may overlap itself.  
	</description>

</edge_loop>

<face>
	<description>
A face is a topological entity of dimensionality 2 corresponding to the intuitive  notion of a piece of surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if present, is an oriented, connected,  finite 2­manifold in R m . A face domain shall not have handles, but it may have holes, each hole  bounded by a loop. The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not  contain its bounds, and 0 ! \Xi ! 1. A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are  defined as face bounds. A face shall have at least one bound, and the bounds shall be distinct  and shall not intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished, using the face outer bound  subtype, as the  “outer” loop of the face. If so, it establishes a preferred way of embedding the  face domain in the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are  “inside” the outer  loop. Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop shall contain any other loop.  This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen.  A geometric surface may be associated with the face. This may be done explicitly through the  face surface subtype, or implicitly if the faces are defined by poly loops. In the latter case,  the surface is the plane containing the points of the poly loops. In either case, a topological  normal n is associated with the face, such that the cross product n \Theta t points toward the interior  of the face, where t is the tangent to a bounding loop. That is, each loop runs counter­clockwise  around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point up. Each loop  is associated through a face bound entity with a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop  direction is oriented correctly with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be reversed  (FALSE). For a face of the subtype face surface, the topological normal n is defined from the  normal of the underlying surface, together with the BOOLEAN attribute same sense, and this  in turn, determines on which side of the loop the face interior lies, using the cross­product rule  described above.  When a vertex loop is used as a face bound the sense of the topological normal is derived  from any other bounding loops, or, in the case of a face surface, from the face geometry and  the same sense flag. If the face has only one bound and this is of type vertex loop, then  the interior of the face is the domain of the face surface.face geometry. In such a case the  underlying surface shall be closed (e.g. a spherical surface.)  The situation is different for a face on an implicit planar surface, such as one defined by poly ­  loops, which has no unique surface normal. Since the face and its bounding loops lie in a plane,  the outer loop can always be found without ambiguity. Since the face is required to be finite,  the face interior must lie inside the outer loop, and outside each of the remaining loops. These  conditions, together with the specified loop orientations, define the topological normal n using  the cross­product rule described above. All poly loop orientations for a given face shall produce  the same value for n.

<face_outer_bound>
	<description>
A face outer bound is a special subtype of face bound which  carries the additional semantics of defining an outer boundary on the face. A face outer ­  bound shall separate the interior of the face from the exterior and shall enclose the interior  domain of the face. No more than one boundary of a face shall be of this type.  
	</description>

</face_outer_bound>

<face_surface>
	<description>
A face surface is a subtype of face in which the geometry is defined by  an associated surface. The portion of the surface used by the face shall be embeddable in the  plane as an open disk, possibly with holes. However, the union of the face with the edges and  vertices of its bounding loops need not be embeddable in the plane. It may, for example, cover an  entire sphere or torus. As both a face and a geometric surface have defined normal directions, a  BOOLEAN flag (the orientation attribute) is used to indicate whether the surface normal agrees  with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the face normal direction. The geometry associated  with any component of the loops of the face shall be consistent with the surface geometry, in  the sense that the domains of all the vertex points and edge curves are contained in the face  geometry surface. A surface may be referenced by more than one face surface.  
	</description>

<loop>
	<description>
A loop is a topological entity constructed from a single vertex, or by stringing  together connected (oriented) edges, or linear segments beginning and ending at the same vertex. A loop has dimensionality 0 or 1. The domain of a 0­dimensional loop is a single point.  The domain of a 1­dimensional loop is a connected, oriented curve, but need not be a manifold.  As the loop is a cycle, the location of its beginning/ending point is arbitrary. The domain of  the loop includes its bounds, and 0 Ÿ \Xi ! 1.  A loop is represented by a single vertex, or by an ordered collection of oriented edges, or by an ordered collection of points.  
	</description>

</loop>

<open_shell>
	<description>
An open shell is a shell of dimensionality 2. Its domain, if present, is  a finite, connected, oriented, 2­manifold with boundary, but is not a closed surface. It can be  thought of as a closed shell with one or more holes punched in it. The domain of an open shell satisfies 0 ! \Xi ! 1. An open shell is functionally more general than a face because its domain  can have handles.  The shell is defined by a collection of faces, which may be oriented faces. The sense of each  face, after taking account of the orientation, shall agree with the shell normal as defined below.  The orientation can be supplied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or  be defaulted to TRUE if the shell member is a face without the orientation attribute.

<oriented_edge>
	<description>
An oriented edge is an edge constructed from another edge and contains a BOOLEAN orientation flag to indicate whether or not the orientation of the constructed  edge agrees with the orientation of the original edge. Except for possible re­orientation, the  oriented edge is equivalent to the original edge.  NOTE A common practice in solid modelling systems is to have an entity that represents the  “use”  or  “traversal” of an edge. This  “use” entity explicitly represents the requirement in a manifold solid  that each edge must be traversed exactly twice, once in each direction. The  “use” functionality is  provided by the edge subtype oriented edge.

<path>
	<description>
A path is a topological entity consisting of an ordered collection of oriented ­  edges, such that the edge start vertex of each edge coincides with the edge end of its predecessor. The path is ordered from the edge start of its first oriented edge to the edge end of its last oriented edge. The BOOLEAN value orientation in the oriented edge indicates   whether the edge direction agrees with the direction of the path (TRUE) or is in the opposite  direction (FALSE).  An individual edge can only be referenced once by an individual path.  An edge can be referenced by multiple paths. An edge can exist independently of a path.

Note that all geometric properties of the workpiece are specified using toleranced_length_measure. If the NC

responsibility to meet these tolerance requirements. On the other hand, data provided to the NC controller for 
explicit specification of movements will have no tolerances as the controller cannot do more than try to follow the 
given theoretical values to the best of its abilities. The same is true for offsets and other data referring to already

<manufacturing_feature>
	<description>
This entity is the supertype of all manufacturing features. When considering 2½D-manufacturing, features are of 
type two5D_manufacturing_feature and may be holes, pockets, etc. When considering freeform manufacturing, 
regions are used in the same sense. 

The manufacturing feature describes the feature as such, e.g. by its geometric properties. It does not give any 
instruction on how the workpiece is manufactured. Such process related information is contained only in the 
operations and depends on the manufacturing method. The methods are described in the technology specific parts 
of ISO 14649. For example, plunging into a pocket, roughing the pocket and finishing the pocket bottom may all be 
individual operations, as well as the finishing of a portion of a freeform surface.

	<its_operations>
		<type>SET [ 0 : ? ] OF machining_operation </type>
		<description>
A set of all operations associated with the feature required for the manufacturing of 
the feature. Note that the operations are not necessarily executed immediately after 
each other. Only the workplan determines the final order of operations of all 
operations included in a given programme, and manufacturing will typically not 
occur feature by feature but rather according to technological criteria like minimised 
tool change. However, it should be guaranteed by the CAM system (or by the 
controller, if the order of execution is determined by an intelligent CNC) that the 
order given in this attribute is never violated.

</manufacturing_feature>

<region>
	<description>
The region is the equivalent of a feature in freeform machining. It describes a bounded area of the final workpiece 
surface to which the associated operations will be applied. Note that for freeform surfaces the regions for different 
operations (e.g. roughing, finishing) may have different shapes based upon technological decisions. 

	</description>

	<feature_placement>
		<type>axis2_placement_3d</type>
		<description>
The placement of the feature relative to the workpiece co-ordinate system. The 
placement is a translation and/or a rotation which transforms the origin of the 
workpiece co-ordinate system origin into the origin of the feature’s local co-ordinate 
system. If no feature_placement is given, the region will use workpiece co-ordinates.

<region_projection>
	<description>
A type of bounded region generated by projecting a closed curve on a surface. Thus, a region can easily be 
defined on an existing surface description. The region projection applies to any workpiece surface it hits when 
moving in space along proj_dir. This is a very simplistic region definition for situations where the use of topology is 
not desired. 
	</description>

	<proj_curve>

negative z-direction of the region’s local coordinate system. The depth is measured 
from the raw piece’s surface, onto which the proj_curve has been projected, to the 
bottom to be machined. The depth is equal for the whole region. In case the bottom’s 
shape shall not be equal to the raw piece’s surface, the entity pocket and its subtypes 
have to be used.

	</description>

	<feature_placement>
		<type>axis2_placement_3d</type>
		<description>
The placement of the feature relative to the workpiece co-ordinate system. The 
placement is a translation and/or a rotation which transforms the origin of the 
workpiece co-ordinate system origin into the origin of the feature’s local co-ordinate 
system. For information on coordinate systems refer to Section 4.6.4.1.2. If the 
manufacturing feature is part of a compound_feature, then its placement is defined 
relative to the compound_feature´s origin.

<machining_feature>
	<description>
The entity machining_feature is the abstract supertype of all features used for feature based 2½D machining. In 
this part the following features are foreseen as they are used in different technology specific parts of ISO 14649: 
planar face, pocket, slot, step, hole, generic feature, and compound feature. The features are defined in close 
resemblance to ISO 10303-224. 

2½D machining is characterised by the fact that most tool movements occur only in the xy plane while the z axis is 
preset to a certain depth in order to remove a layer of material. For this reason, all machining features have a 
depth. 

All feature geometry, e.g. the contour describing the outline of a pocket, is described in a local xyz co-ordinate 
system. The definition of the coordinate system’s orientation is given in the machining method specific parts. The 
surrounding surface of the workpiece and the definition of the planar contour of the feature are assumed to lie in 
the xy plane (z = 0). The material is assumed to be in negative z direction of the xy-plane. In other words, a positive 
depth within a machining operation requires the tool to advance in negative z direction into the material’s direction. 

As ISO 14649 allows for a 3D description of the overall workpiece geometry, the inherited attribute 
feature_placement specifies the actual location of the feature within the workpiece co-ordinate system. 


	</description>

	<depth>
		<type>elementary_surface</type>
		<description>
The depth of the feature is described by a plane which includes the lowest points of 
the feature (z.LT.0) measured in the feautre’s local cartesian-cooridnate system. If the 
depth is not an orthogonal plane to the z-axis this implies, that the bottom of the 
feature is inclined. Depending on the explicit features there can be described more 
complex bottom shapes. 
		</description>
	</depth>
</machining_feature>

<planar_face>
	<description>
The planar face is used to describe machining of the outer face of a workpiece. The geometry of the planar face is 
given through the boundary and the depth (defined by the supertype). The depth denotes the the bottom of the 
material that needs to be taken away from the workpiece to reach the final shape of the feature. The elementary 
surface describing the depth can be inclined or orthogonal to the feature’s local z-axis. The planar face may also 
have one or more bosses where no cutting will be done.

by a single sweep of a tool along the course of travel. In this case, the width of the slot equals the shape of the tool. 
In case of a milling operation the shape is given by the tool’s diameter. If a workingstep which manufactures this

<boss>
	<description>
A boss is a feature which has to be related to an other feature. No separate workingstep can be assigned to 
manufacture a boss (i.e. it is not possible to first cut the feature and then cut the boss). Instead, the boss is that 
material which remains unworked after the machining of a feature with a boss. For this reason, boss is not an 
independent machining feature but exists only as an attribute.

feature. When travelling along the profile based as defined by its sense, the material 
is to the left of the profile.

<transition_feature>
	<description>
A transition feature may be added at the border of two features. Example: An edge round or a chamfer between 
two planar faces or between a planar face and a pocket. Unlike in ISO 10303-224, only those transition features 
which are generated using additional tool movements are considered here. Example: An edge round between a 
pocket and a planar face needs an additional manufacturing operation (workingstep). On the contrary, a fillet 
between the sides and the bottom of a pocket results from the geometry of the tool and thus needs no additional 
tool movement. It is therefore not considered in this context.

<workingstep>
	<description>
The workingsteps represent the essential building blocks of an ISO 14649 NC programme. They can either be 
technology-independent actions, like rapid movements or probing operations, or machining workingsteps which 
relate to the different technologies like milling, drilling, turning etc. 

The actual content of the workingsteps is specified in the entity operation and its subtypes. The reason for this 
design is the possibility to re-use the information specified for an operation for several features of the workpiece. 
An operation can be associated with multiple features and can be used in different locations. A workingstep, on the 
other hand, is unique. Duplicating a workingstep in a workplan will replicate the exact same physical machine 
action. For more information on operations
	</description>

	<its_secplane>
		<type>elementary_surface</type>
		<description>
The security plane for the workingstep. On or above this plane, i. e. for z values 
greater than those of the elementary_surface, a safe movement of the tool without 
danger of collision is possible. The dimensions given are relative coordinates as 
measured from the workpiece co-ordinate system or, if this workingstep is associated 
with a manufacturing_feature, in the local co-ordinate system of the feature.
		</description>
	</its_secplane>
</workingstep>

<machining_workingstep>
	<description>
Machining workingsteps represent the machining process for a specified area of the workpiece. As opposed to the 
other workingsteps, machining workingsteps cannot exist independent of a feature. Rather, they specify the 
association between a distinct feature and an operation to be performed on the feature. This removes the 
ambiguity of the n:1 relation between features and operations, thus creating an unambiguous specification which 
can be executed by the machine. 

As the underlying operation, the machining workingstep is characterised by the use of a single tool and a set of 
technological parameters which normally remain constant during the reign of this machining workingstep. Upon the 
execution of a machining workingstep the first operation will be, if necessary, a tool change. During the machining 
workingstep, no tool change is possible. 

The machine is instructed to reach the operating conditions specified by its_operation (attributes its_tool and 
its_technology) before the operation of the workingstep commences. If the machine is unable to reach these 
conditions during the preceding workingstep (e.g. during a preceding rapid movement) a halt will occur before the 
execution of the workingstep until all parameters are stable. 

See the technology specific parts of ISO 14649 for details on operations, especially on how the association 
between the feature and the operation will change the interpretation of the operation.

		<description>

geometry of the workpiece. If given the controller can compare the geometry change 
described by this attribute with the geometry change predicted by its internal 
algorithm. ISO 14649 does not describe how closely the two geometries must match 
in order for the controller to be considered to be in conformance.

<in_process_geometry>
	<description>
Entity to represent in-process geometry for additional checking routines. A CAM system can use this information to 
describe the predicted effect of an operation on one feature. The controller can compare the geometry given in this 
entity with the geometry change predicted by its internal algorithm. ISO 14649 does not describe how closely the 
two geometries must match in order for the controller to be considered to be in conformance.

<rapid_movement>
	<description>
For rapid movements between two workingsteps the entity rapid_movement is used. If no toolpath is given, i. e. the 
inherited attribute its_toolpath is not set, the NC controller will move the tool in rapid motion from the current 
position to the beginning of the next workingstep which needs to have a defined starting point. The connection will 
be done via the security plane. 

If a toolpath is specified, this toolpath will be executed in rapid motion. Note that a toolpath of type parameterised 
path can be used so as to avoid an explicit toolpath definition in cartesian space. This will provide greater flexibility 
in case of changing start and/or end points of the neighbouring workingsteps. 

Unlike a machining workingstep, the rapid movement by itself has no well-defined start and end point unless an 
explicit toolpath is specified in cartesian space. 

If rapid_movement is used during a five-axis machining operation, it will interpolate the tool direction between the 
previous and the next workingstep. In this case, the tool will retract in the tool direction from the last point of the 
previous workingstep. On the security plane the tool will rotate to the new tool direction, and then it will move down 
in the tool direction for the first point of the next workingstep. No change of the tool direction takes place during the 
lift and approach to and from the security plane. 

However, if a toolpath is specified and the toolpath contains an explicit definition of the toolaxis then this definition 
will prevail. 
	</description>

</rapid_movement>

<return_home>
	<description>
This workingstep positions all machine axes to the machine-defined home position in the absolute machine 
coordinate system with a pre-defined sequence. This should normally be the last operation in a workplan.

</return_home>

<touch_probing>
	<description>
This is the supertype of touch probe workingsteps. Unlike other workingsteps, touch_probing returns a value for 
further consideration by the NC programme. 

In future releases of this part of ISO 14649, touch_probing may be moved to a separate part specifying operations 
for measurement equipment. In this case it will become a subtype of machining_operation and needs to be 
associated with an appropriate measurement feature.

<workpiece_probing>
	<description>
Probing of a dimension with one axis movement. Probing tool movement starts at start_position in the direction 
"direction" towards the workpiece. When the probe tool touches the workpiece, the machine stops and the 
difference of expected_value and tool position is stored in the inherited attribute measured_offset. 

Like machining_workingstep, workpiece_probing has a well defined start point and cannot be the first element in a 
workplan.

<workpiece_complete_probing>
	<description>
This entity is similar to workpiece probing only that a complete measurement cycle at six locations of the given 
workpiece is automatically performed and the translation and rotational offset of the detected workpiece position 
compared to the given workpiece is computed. The locations of probing are automatically determined by the NC 
controller based on the geometry of the workpiece. The offset vector is returned in computed_offset while the 
inherited attributed measured_offset will hold the average of all (six) measured offsets. 

Based on the automatic determination of the probing locations, workpiece_complete_probing does not have a well 
defined start point.

<tool_probing>
	<description>
Probing of the length and width/diameter of a tool. The selected tool starts its movement at a machine dependent 
start position. From that position the tool position is shifted to a fixed sensor position by the offset. Then the tool is 
moved in direction to the sensor until contact. This is done in longitudinal and perpendicular direction of the tool-
axis. 

The result of probing is stored in the inherited attribute measured_offset and the NC controllers tool database is 
automatically updated. NC controllers providing tool correction algorithms are expected to use the updated 
information of its_tool from the moment the tool_probing workingstep has been completed.

<parallel>
	<description>
The parallel entity allows to run several executables in parallel. All branches are started at the same time; the 
execution of the parallel entity ends when the last branch has finished. If the NC controller determines that the 
branches cannot be executed in parallel the machine will stop with an error condition. Note that normally parallel 
execution will require the use of different channels in each branch. NC functions can be used to synchronise events 
across different channels.

	</its_rvalue>
</assignment>

<nc_variable>
	<description>
The variable concept introduced here is primitive. Only numeric variables are allowed. The NC controller will map 
the variable name given by this entity to an internal storage. The attribute its_name must therefore be unique 
throughout the entire model supplied by an ISO 14649 physical file. Not that several nc_variable entities using the 
same name will actually refer to the same storage location. 

Accessing nc_variables in a program_structure entity may take place only after the previous program_structure has 
been completely executed by the machine. Note that due to the pipeline concept of most NC controllers there can 
be a significant time gap between the interpretation of the program and the actual execution. It is there the 
responsibility of the NC controller to halt interpretation until the value of the nc_variable(s) used are available. This 
is especially true for the lvalue in an assignment operation because the premature execution of the assignment 
would allow an ongoing NC process to overwrite the assigned nc_variable before it is used, leading to unexpected 
and possibly fatal results. 

Note also that there is no guarantee at which time a certain value from any parallel branch would be available. If 
timing matters, a synchronising NC function has to be inserted before the use of a nc_variable. 

Variables can be used to access controller-internal information, like sensor readings. This, however, would be 
controller-dependent and implemented by the use of reserved names as specified by the control vendor.

<operation>
	<description>
Operations are used to specify the content of a workingstep. Unlike a workingstep, an operation cannot be 
executed by itself – unless it is also a workingstep by means of multiple inheritance, like rapid_movement or 
touch_probing. The latter do not require the presence of a feature for unambiguous interpretation. 

However, the most typical operation, machining operation, needs an association with a manufacturing feature in 
order to be interpreted. It relies on the geometric information provided by the feature, namely its placement in the 
workpiece co-ordinate system. Such association can either be established through a reference from a 
manufacturing_feature or through a reference from a machining_workingstep which references in turn a 
manufacturing_feature. 

The important difference between a workingstep and an operation is in the number of associated features. The 
workingstep is associated with zero or one features. So at the time of execution the NC controller will know 
unambiguously which feature to use for geometric placement (or to use workpiece co-ordinates if no feature is 
associated). A workingstep is thus unique. Duplicating a workingstep in a workplan will replicate the exact same 
physical machine action. 

The operation on the other hand can be associated with zero or multiple features. The same operation can thus be 
used in different locations. The NC controller would be unable to decide on which of the associated features to 
execute the operation, so an execution of a “naked” operation is not possible. 

The reason for this design is the possible re-use of operation data for several manufacturing features. Consider ten 
identical holes in different positions around the workpiece. They can all share the operation data, but they can not 
share the workingsteps which represent an operation at a certain instance in time and space. As the “heavyweight” 
operation entities can be shared, this may reduce the volume of data to be exchanged. 

The supertype operation specifies the generic data required by all operations. 

All operations have the option of specifying an explicit toolpath. For 2½D machining operations, many numerical 
controls will specify cycles for generating their own toolpaths. However, for older controls which are not able to 
generate toolpaths or if technological reasons require the communication of exactly prescribed toolpaths, the 
attribute its_toolpath may be used. Also, the 3-to 5-axis milling of freeform surfaces will typically require the explicit 
specification of toolpaths by a CAM system. 

	</description>

	<its_toolpath>
		<type>toolpath_list</type>
		<description>
Its_toolpath defines a list of all toolpaths in this operation. Note: If its_toolpath 
exists, the attribute its_machining_strategy in the subtype machining_operation is for 
information only. Also, all semantics or parameters provided by the operation will be 
overridden by its_toolpath. The toolpaths are given in coordinates as measured from 
the workpiece co-ordinate system or, if this operation is associated with a 
manufacturing_feature, in the local co-ordinate system of the feature. 
		</description>
	</its_toolpath>
	<its_tool_direction>
		<type>tool_direction</type>
		<description>
Specification of the type of tool orientation used. If none is given, a technology 
specific default is assumed. Therefore refer to the technology specific parts of ISO 
14649. 

Note that the operation is geometrically linked with the associated manufacturing_feature, if such an association 
exists. If the feature has a feature_placement attribute, this transformation will also apply to all geometry specified 
here, i. e. its_toolpath and to all other geometric information like directions or orientations which may be used in 
subtypes of operation. In other words, all geometry and parameters of the machining_operation are defined in the 
local co-ordinate system of the feature. As the operation may be associated with multiple manufacturing_features it 
can only be interpreted in the context of such feature. 

For features without a feature_placement attribute or for operations without an associated feature, all data is to be 
interpreted in workpiece co-ordinates as specified by the attribute its_origin of the workplan which uses this 
operation.

	</its_tool_direction>

<toolpath_list>

other.
	</description>

	<its_list>
		<type>LIST [ 1 : ? ] OF toolpath </type>
		<description>
A list of toolpaths. These toolpaths shall be executed in the defined order.

	<description>
The following entities define the tool direction for freeform machining. 

	</description>

</tool_direction>

<two_axes>
	<description>
Only two axes can be simultaneously active. 

	</description>

</two_axes>

<three_axes>
	<description>
Simultaneous tool movements in three axes are used for machining. The tool orientation is always parallel to the 
third axis (generally, the z axis) in the machine co-ordinate system. Therefore the tool direction will not be affected 
by any workpiece placements or workingstep transformation. 
	</description>

</three_axes>

<machining_operation>
	<description>
Machining operations define the machining process for a limited area of the workpiece, i. e. the contents of a 
machining workingstep. For the feature to which they refer they specify, at a minimum, the tool to be used, and a 
set of technological parameters. This data forms an integral part of the operation and cannot be normally changed 
during its scope. 

However, for special operations, and if an explicit toolpath is provided in the inherited attribute its_toolpath, it is also 
possible to specify certain deviating parameters along portions of the toolpath. In this case, the data given in 
machining_operation serves as default data in case no specific technological information for a toolpath is provided. 
Note that any parameters or semantics specified by this operation or the associated feature will be overridden by 
the toolpath definition, even if the actions defined by the toolpath contradict the intuitive notion of this operation of 
the associated feature. In other words, you can even use a pocket operation to bore a hole. 

The first tool movement within a machining_operation will typically be an approach movement to the defined start 
point, allowing the machine to reach its operating speed. This can be either be defined explicitly in a toolpath, or by 
means of a parameterised path, or it can be defined within the strategy for the operation where the exact definition 
of the path is left to the NC controller. The last tool movement will typically be a retract or lift movement. 

The tool movement within the machining_operation, unless defined by an explicit toolpath, will be determined by 
the technology-dependent strategy and additional parameters as defined by subtypes of machining_operation. 

Machining_operation is the supertype for all technologies included in ISO 14649. For each of these technologies, 
specific machining strategies are defined in separate, technology depending parts. They may be used to instruct 
the NC controller on how to generate toolpaths if no toolpath is explicitly specified for this operation. 


	</description>

	<its_id>
		<type>identifier</type>
		<description>
A unique identifier of the operation. 

		</description>
	</its_id>
	<retract_plane>
		<type>length_measure</type>
		<description>
The height of a retract plane associated with this operation. This is not the security 
plane. The start and the end point of the operation – as discussed in Section 4.6.2.1 – 
shall be within z-direction at the length given by the attribute retract_plane. It is 
guaranteed that the approach movement from the retract plane to the first cut and the 
lift movement from the last cut to the retract plane are executed in cutting feed as 
specified for the operation. A change to rapid feed, e.g. to reach the security plane, 
can only occur above this plane, and only in the context of a new operation which 
should be of type rapid_movement. 

If not given, and if the inherited attribute its_toolpath is not given, the NC controller 
will determine an appropriate retract plane which may be the security plane. If 
its_toolpath is given, or if approach or retract strategies are given which do not make 
use of a retract plane, this attribute will be ignored. 

Depending on the type of operation, the attribute will be interpreted as follows: 

• 
For plane milling or drilling operations, retract_plane is the z coordinate of the 
retract plane from which the tool starts (for approach) and to which it is 
retracted (for retract movements). 
• 
For side milling, retract_plane indicates a distance perpendicular to the 
manufacutred surface. 
• 
For freeform milling, retract_plane is the distance between the workpiece 
surface and the retract plane which is oriented perpendicular to the surface 
normal in the first cutting point (for approach) or the last cutting point (for lift). 
		</description>
	</retract_plane>
	<start_point>
		<type>cartesian_point</type>
		<description>
Optional starting point of the cutting process specified as tool centre point in the 
local xy plane. The z co-ordinate of start_point is determined depending on the type 
of operation: 

• 
For milling, the z co-ordinate is the depth of the first cut, excluding any plunge 
or approach movements. If an approach or plunge movement is used, the actual 
start point of the operation will be the start point of that approach or plunge 
movement which can be calculated based on this attribute. The start_point will 
be reached at the end of such approach or plunge. Thus the x and y co-ordinates 
of start_point not necessarily coincide with those of the start point of the 
operation, depending on the type of approach or plunge. 
• 
For drilling, the start_point is identical with the start point of the operation as no 
approach or plunge is foreseen here. Therefore, the z co-ordinate is given by the 
attribute retract_plane. 
If this attribute is given, the operation has a defined start point as discussed in 
Section 4.6.2.1, otherwise not. In the latter case, the NC controller will determine a 
reasonable default. 

If its_toolpath is given, or if start_point specifies a point violating the feature’s 
boundary or otherwise incompatible with the machining strategy, this attribute will 
be ignored.
		</description>
	</start_point>
	<its_tool>
		<type>machining_tool</type>
		<description>
The tool which has to be used for this workingstep. For the definition of 
machining_tool, please refer to technology-specific parts of ISO 14649. It is 
important to understand that the tool data given describes the ideal required tool. If 
this attribute calls for a tool with diameter 10.0 mm, the NC controller may select a 
tool with diameter 9.983 mm provided that it has the ability for on-line tool 
correction and has the actual value of the tool stored in its tool memory data, and 
provided that the result of the operation remains within the given tolerances of the 
feature. (In other words, the NC controller is not allowed to select a 9.983 mm drill if 
the hole has the toleranced dimension 10.0-0.01 mm.) The possibility to find a suitable 
tool in the machine’s tool magazine is reduced the more details for the tool are 
specified. So only the technologically necessary parameters should be given. (In 
other words, do not specify a tool length if only the diameter is of importance.) If a 
tool id is specified, only an exact match can be selected.

<machine_functions>
	<description>
Each technology has its specific machine functions. This entity is their abstract supertype. 

	</description>

</machine_functions>

<toolpath>
	<description>
This is the supertype for all explicit toolpaths. If needed, the toolpaths can have technological parameters and the 
machine functions which override the default value specified at the operation level. 

If the attributes its_technology and/or its_machine_functions are given, the machine is instructed to reach the 
specified operating conditions before entering the toolpath. Unlike the similar case for workingsteps, no halt is 
allowed between toolpaths in an operation’s toolpath list. So the previous toolpath may be adversely affected if a 
significant change of parameters occurs and the controller tries to provide run up to these parameters prior to the 
current toolpath. Also, if the time span of the previous toolpath is insufficient to reach stable parameters, there is no 
guarantee that the new toolpath will be using these parameters from the start. 

Caution is therefore advised when using technological parameters at the toolpath level. If required, e.g. for special 
operations requiring a reversing of the spindle rotation, a feedstop toolpath should be inserted in order to grant the 
machine sufficient time for changing the parameters.

case there is a toolpath of higher priority (true) than the geometry of the path 
generation based on the manufacturing feature is subordinated to this toolpath.

<toolpath_speed>
	<description>
This is a one-dimensional curve specifying the speed profile as defined by type positive_ratio_measure. If the 
attribute basiccurve of the toolpath exists, the parameterisation of speed must be the same as basiccurve. 
Otherwise, speed must be parameterised by the path length of the underlying toolpath, i. e. the first parameter is 0, 
the last parameter equals the length of the underlying toolpath as defined by type length_measure.

<axis_trajectory>
	<description>
Axis trajectories do not directly define a tool movement, but rather the movement of the machine axis. They are 
comparable to the G0/G1 commands of ISO 6983. 

They should not be used because the resulting NC programme will no longer be machine independent.

<parameterised_path>
	<description>
This subtype of the toolpath entity is used to define help movements like connectors, approach and lift movements 
without giving the actual tool path. The movement is rather described by a movement type and its parameters. The 
CNC itself then has to calculate the resulting toolpath for the actual tool. 

This concept is especially useful when working with cutter contact trajectories for the milling operations. As cutter 
contact trajectories can only be used for motions on the workpiece surface itself there is a need for defining the 
connecting movements between the individual toolpaths in an indirect way. Also, the parameterised paths given 
here can be used to connect cutter contact and cutter location trajectories. 

Note that even though the parameterised paths are named for their most frequent use they can be used for any 
portion of a toolpath description just as any other form of toolpath. Their actual use is not indicated by the entity 
names but rather by the inherited its_type attribute. 
	</description>

</parameterised_path>

<connector>
	<description>
The connector entity defines a connection path between a lift and a following approach movement. This path type if 
typically needed to implement a rapid_movement operation but can also be used within a machining operation for 
connecting several cutting paths. 
	</description>

</connector>

<connect_secplane>
	<description>
The security plane connector moves the tool up to the security plane until the cutter location point reaches the 
security plane, then linear to the projected starting point of the following movement and again from the security 
plane down to this starting point. This type of connection may be needed for unidirectional machining of freeform 
surface. For bidirectional machining, a connect_direct between the preceding lift and the following approach 
movement will be more efficient. 
	</description>

will be in tool direction.

</connect_secplane>

<connect_direct>
	<description>
The direct connector moves the tool in a straight line from the end point of the previous toolpath to the starting point 
of the next toolpath. 
	</description>

</connect_direct>

<approach_lift_path>
	<description>
This subtype of parameterised path describes the lift and approach movement in terms of angles or tangential 
movements. See also Section 4.8.1. The strategy will initiate the generation of toolpath based on the surrounding 
feature. This entity, on the other hand, specifies a distinct path in cartesian space. It can be the result of a path 
generation based on an air strategy in which case the fix_point would lie in the retract_plane of the associated 
operation. 
	</description>

	<fix_point>
		<type>cartesian_point</type>
		<description>
 The starting point for the approach movement or the destination for the lift 
movement in the workpiece co-ordinate system, or the feature’s local co-ordinate 
system, respectively. The reference point on the tool is the tool center point (tcp), 
which is the point where the rotational axis of the tool leaves the tip. 
		</description>
	</fix_point>
	<fix_point_dir>
		<type>direction</type>
		<description>
The tool direction in fix_point as 3D vector in the workpiece co-ordinate system, or 
the feature’s local co-ordinate system, respectively. If given, the machine will 
attempt to interpolate between the tool direction in the fix point and the tool 
direction in the start (approach) or end (lift) point of the connecting toolpath during 
the approach/lift movement. If not given, the tool direction will not be changed 
during the approach/lift movement.

<toolpath_type>
	<description>
Enumerator describing the type of the trajectory. This can be used by the controller e.g. to identify whether rapid
motion may be allowed or not.

lift: The movement away from the workpiece.
connect: The connecting movement (usually in rapid speed) between the lift and the approach
movement.
non_contact: A movement without contact with the workpiece.
contact: A movement with contact of the workpiece.
trajectory_path: A movement described by a trajectory.
Note that any toolpath can be tagged with any of these types. For example, it is not necessary to use specialised
toolpath elements like approach_lift_path in order to build an approach movement. This can just as well done
through a pre-calculated cutter location path using the approach toolpath_type.
